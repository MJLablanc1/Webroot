                    and a great reference for anyone getting back into web development. The tutorials present are 
                    complete, but simple to understand easily. Reviewing this site, even after a few projects, 
                    will keep you aware of all the tools at your disposal.<br />

                    A commonly used forum for many programming topics, from html issues to data base mishaps. 
                    Stack Exchange is a forum used by nearly all programmers, and a reminder that you are not 
                    the first to encounter a specific problem, and there are likely answers already out there. 
                    This site is useful for all programmers of all languages, and all parts of development. 
                    As a budding developer, it is a useful resource for quick detailed answers, eventually I 
                    would like to give back and answer questions myself.<br />

                     A development manger and collaboration combo. GitHub leads the development world with its 
                     extensive repository technology and allows easy collaboration with anyone through their 
                     branch management. Everyone in the programming sphere should have a GitHub account, and 
                     I have no doubt that I’ll using GitHub professionally and personally through my programming 
                     career, as it is ubiquitous in the industry.<br />

                <p id="pWeb"><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">BootStrap</a><br />
                    A Simple site with a lot of potential to quicken the 
                    development cycle of websites. An extensive front-end 
                    library to make creating pleasing website layouts easier. 
                    As someone who is more interested in back-end development, 
                    Bootstrap will allow me to quickly mockup a decent website 
                    will little effort. It’ll allow professional looking small-scale 
                    projects and make large projects quicker to develop.<br />

                    A blog with a focus on good old CSS. Bootstrap may make 
                    front-end development a breeze, but it can’t do everything. 
                    That where CSS Tricks comes in. There are many articles on 
                    the intricacies of CSS and way to improve any website’s CSS. 
                    As an always studying developer, having good CSS skills will 
                    be needed, and CSS Tricks will keep me current.<br />

                    The documentation king of documentation. DevDocs is a collection 
                    of fast language and API documentation. Having many common references 
                    in one place is an easy resource for learning and maintaining code. 
                    I hope this project is continued and added to.<br />
